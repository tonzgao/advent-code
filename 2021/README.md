# [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Partially inspired by [Norvig's pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/Advent-2020.ipynb), although I probably won't be using the same style.

Goals
------
* Try to finish all gold stars on day of puzzle
* Learn new python features
* Investigate github copilot
